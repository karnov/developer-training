# Editor installation

Ruby is a very concise language so you can do fine with almost any editor that can provide syntax highlightning for Ruby.

I recommend [Atom](https://atom.io/) or the very similar [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Exercise

Install an editor

Create a new folder for all your software projects, e.g. a folder called `src` in your users home folder

```bash
$ mkdir ~/src
```

Create a new software project there
